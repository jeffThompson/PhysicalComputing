# ANALOG SENSORS

### TLDR  
* Due March 22  
  * **Feb 22: Monday schedule, no class!**  
  * For Mar 1: Horrible prototypes  
  * For Mar 8: Work-in-progress, part ready for laser  
  * **Mar 15: Spring break, no class!**  
  * For Mar 22: Finished project due  
* Make something using at least one analog sensor

### ASSIGNMENT  
Digital inputs, like buttons, only have on/off states which is a serious limitation! But analog sensors, which are the focus of this project, give us a range of values. This is great for getting input from the world into your project: things like temperature, light, humidity, even the distance to objects!

Your assignment is wide open, with two requirements: it must use at least one analog sensor and you need to use the laser-cutter for something. You're welcome to use buttons and LEDs too, and you can include more than one analog sensor. The media, intention, and level of usefulness is up to you!

### FOR MARCH 1  
**Reminder, Tuesday, February 22 is a Monday schedule â€“ we won't meet that week!**

To kick off our project, this week will be all about coming up with ideas. This can be the hardest part, staring at a blank sketchbook page or file. To help overcome this, we'll start with some quick drawings. Look at the sensors you have and think about ways you could use them. Spend about 20 minutes writing down (or doodling) as many ideas as you can. Don't edit yourself and feel free to "riff" on an idea, thinking up multiple iterations. No one will see these: they're just about getting your brain working.

With some ideas kicking around, pick one you're most excited about. Using very limited supplies, you should make a horrible prototypes of that idea.

Your supplies are limited to:  
* Copy/printer paper  
* Cardstock (optional)  
* Pencil, pen, and markers  
* Scissors and/or knife  
* Ruler and/or compass  

Using just the supplies above, create a **full-scale version of all the parts your project** in paper. Don't stress about perfect lines or making things look just right! In fact, these should remain rough and crappy. This process is called *paper prototyping,* and it's a wondeful way to explore possibilities quickly. If you were to start in Illustrator or CAD, you'd make something wonderful but also something you'd be less likely to want to change. But by being intentionally horrible, you won't feel bad about taping on some extra paper, scribbling something out, or throwing the whole thing away.

Think of your prototype as serving two purposes: it lets you see the thing you want to make right away and you can show that thing to us. We'll demo your prototypes in class next week, so think about how to explain it to us.
