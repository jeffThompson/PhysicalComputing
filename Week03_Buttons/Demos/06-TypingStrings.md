# TYPING STRINGS

Sending a single key when the button is pressed mimics a normal keyboard, but that's not all we can do! The `HID` library also lets us send [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) (a set of characters, like a word or sentence) with only a single button. (Of course, we could do this using the previous example, but that would be super messy.)

We'll need to use an additional library for this, but it's already included in the `HID` folder we added in the last example. The button setup is the same too, so we'll just jump into the code!

### STUFF YOU'LL NEED  

* One pushbutton  
* Jumper wires  
* Feather board  
* USB cable

### BASIC SETUP   
First, we'll create the button, LED, and keyboard, just like before:

```python
import board
import digitalio
import time

from adafruit_debouncer import Debouncer

import usb_hid
from adafruit_hid.keyboard import Keyboard
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode

pin = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D5)
pin.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP
button = Debouncer(pin)

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

time.sleep(1)
keyboard = Keyboard(usb_hid.devices)
```

We also need to add this line:  

```python
keyboard_layout = KeyboardLayoutUS(keyboard)
```

This is required for us to send strings instead of individual key presses. Since keyboards for different languages (and even different regions) have [different layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout), we need to tell the Feather which one to use so it sends the right keys. This example uses a US layout, since that's where I'm based. 

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What about other languages or countries? The library appears to work with other layouts too, but I don't have a good way to test this, sorry! You can [try following these instructions](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts). If you have success, please let me know and I will update this tutorial!

### SENDING STRINGS  
With our setup done, let's send some text! This is super easy with the `write()` command:

```python
keyboard_layout.write('hello')
```

We don't need the `release_all()` command after, since the library handles all this for us. Let's combine this with the button code and some regular key presses:

```python
while True:
  button.update()
  
  if button.rose:
    led.value = False
  
  if button.fell:
    led.value = True
    
    # write something
    keyboard_layout.write('hello')
    keyboard.press(Keycode.RETURN)
    keyboard.release_all()
    
    # then write something else, feel
    # sheepish, then delete it
    keyboard_layout.write('farts')
    
    # add some delays throughout to 
    # make it more realistic
    time.sleep(0.5)
    for i in range(0, 5):
        keyboard.press(Keycode.BACKSPACE)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        keyboard.release_all()
```

If you push the button, you should see the word `hello` appear, then your cursor will go down to a new line by sending the return key. After that it prints a word then deletes it letter-by-letter. All these commands happen super quick, but we can use `time.sleep()` to simulate a person typing.

### FULL CODE EXAMPLE  

```python
import board
import digitalio
import time

from adafruit_debouncer import Debouncer

import usb_hid
from adafruit_hid.keyboard import Keyboard
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode

pin = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D5)
pin.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP
button = Debouncer(pin)

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

time.sleep(1)
keyboard = Keyboard(usb_hid.devices)

while True:
  button.update()
  
  if button.rose:
    led.value = False
  
  if button.fell:
    led.value = True
    
    # write something
    keyboard_layout.write('hello')
    keyboard.press(Keycode.RETURN)
    keyboard.release_all()
    
    # then write something else
    # and then delete it
    keyboard_layout.write('farts')
    
    # add some delays throughout to 
    # make it more realistic
    time.sleep(0.5)
    for i in range(0, 5):
        keyboard.press(Keycode.BACKSPACE)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        keyboard.release_all()

```

### CHALLENGES  

1. Can you find a poem or song lyrics that you like and have it type out when the button is pressed? Can you add delays (or even randomized ones!) to simulate a person typing?  
2. Sending strings to a text editor is pretty alright, but can you think of other places where typing text would be helpful or fun? Think about all the ways you use your keyboard on a regular basis
