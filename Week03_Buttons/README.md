# BUTTONS: WEIRD KEYBOARDS

### TLDR  
* Due Feb 15  
  * For Feb 8: breadboard prototype, materials gathered  
  * For Feb 15: final version done  
* Make a weird keyboard for your computer  
* Buttons and LEDs only, but other physical materials are great!  
* No need to turn in anything on Canvas  
* **Reminder! You'll need all your remaining supplies the week this project is due. If you haven't ordered them, please do so ASAP!**

### ASSIGNMENT  
Having seen how to program our Feather boards and digital outputs in the form of LEDs, our next project is all about digital inputs! We'll start with the simplest of all: switches, aka buttons. These come in a range of sizes and shapes, but they all work the same basic way, either allowing electricity to flow through them or not. (In fact, [your entire computer is essentially made of super tiny switches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1hJoalcK68) too!) In addition to learning how to wire and read various switches, we'll also look at using Circuit Python's `HID` (human interface device) library. This lets your Feather appear as a keyboard (and mouse, which we'll see later) to your computer!

With that in mind, over the next two weeks your assignment is to build a ["weird"](https://www.google.com/search?channel=nus5&client=firefox-b-1-d&q=weird) keyboard for your computer. The goal here is an experimental input device that is both functional (to whatever degree you want) and is built into some kind of finished form: a case, embedded in an object, sewn into your clothes, part of a sculpture, etc. Your keyboard should use at least two buttons and can include LEDs, if you want.

What your keyboard does, what it looks like, etc is all up to you but embrace the idea of a "weird" keyboard!

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There are lots of other sensors that work digitally, though buttons are the most simple. Many use communications protocols like I2C, which allow data to be sent to the digital pins and even chaining of sensors together! We'll learn more about this later in the semester.

### FOR FEBRUARY 8  
For next week, you should make a rough prototype of your keyboard using your breadboard. This doesn't need to use the final buttons or objects you intend for your keyboard, but should connect to your computer and be able to demo the basic functionality you're after. 

**Keep a list of stuff you're stuck on or need help with!** We can go over all of this during class next week.

You should also gather the materials you think you'll need for this project and bring them to class next week. This includes objects that will be part of your keyboard, but may also mean getting different buttons to work with. You can look at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/category/235) but some other suppliers are listed below. If you see something you like, be sure to order it ASAP so it will get here in time.

Other suppliers to check out:  

* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/145) (a lot like Adafruit)  
* [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/category/switches/15) (huge selection ‚Äì over 330k different switches in stock!)  
* [Electronics Goldmine](https://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/) (hit or miss, but super fun)  
* [American Science & Surplus](https://www.sciplus.com/) (similar)

### FOR FEBRUARY 15  
For next week, please finish your project and prepare a simple demo to show it off! Think about not just what your keyboard looks like but also what use makes most sense for it. Is this a general-purpose keyboard or one for a niche function? Does your keyboard make that easier or intentionally difficult?

We'll record some short demo videos of your keyboards in class, too. No need to turn in anything on Canvas.

**Reminder! You need all your remaining parts starting next week, so if you haven't ordered them, you should do so immediately!**

### PROJECTS SHOWN    
* Douglass Engelbart's [*Mother of All Demos*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5PgQS3ZBWA), a public demonstration in 1968 of many firsts: the first computer mouse, interactive computing, and video teleconferencing  
* Mattel's 1977 handheld game [*Football*](http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/FB.htm), notable for having just a few buttons and some LEDs ([see it in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ5TVoVD5Ss))  
* Alex Myer's [prepared game controllers](http://www.alexmyers.info/pages/prepcont/index.html)  
* Encoding data digitally has been happening for centuries!  
  * [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), remarkable for using just two values (a short and long pulse) to encode letters to be sent via [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy) (which in itself has an intersting history: smoke, fires, and reflected light have all been used to send messages over great distances)  
  * [Flag semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore) is another encoding system, used to send visual signals over long distances  
* Want more inspiration? Lots of great online collections: [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/search/collection-images?edan_local=&edan_q=computer%2Bkeyboard&), the [Computer History Museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/search/?s=keyboard&f=physicalobject) (CA), [Computing History Centre](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/pages/49753/site-search/?q=keyboard&area[0]=item&section[0][0]=Browse%20Our%20Collection&section[1][0]=Peripherals) (UK), and a [cool site from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection/browse.aspx?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fbibuxton%2Fbuxtoncollection%2Fbrowse.aspx) showing historical computer input devices 
* Lots more examples in this week's `Images` folder too!
