# MOTORS

### TLDR  
* Due April 19  
  * For April 5: project drawings, BOM  
  * For April 12: prototype  
  * For April 19: finished project, final project pitch  
* Make something using at least one motor  

***

### ASSIGNMENT  
For our last regular assignment of the semester, we'll explore adding motors to make our projects move! The only requirement for this project is that you use at least one motor. Feel free to add LEDs, sensors, and anything else you want as well.

Of course, kinetic work can require a lot of complicated engineering: parts have to fit together, move freely, and often translate rotational movement to something else. But that doesn't need to be the case: many of the examples below aren't technically complex but transform into something interesting through movement! And while *very* rudimentary CNC is possible with servo motors, you'll have a lot more fun idf you think of them as low-precision ways to make things move.

### FOR APRIL 5  
This week, to kick off the project, please make a detailed drawing of what you want to make. You're welcome to work analog or digitally, whichever feels more fluid for you. This should be as detailed as you can make it! The goal here is not just to think through what this thing will look like, but also:

* What goes into it? (Motor, wires, Feather, etc)  
* How those parts connect to each other  
* Size, color, materials, texture  
* Labels and arrows to make notes and explain what moves and how  

When finished, please also create a *bill of materials* (aka "BOM"). A BOM is a document, usually a spreadsheet but sometimes just a text file, that lists all the parts necessary for your project. This should include big stuff like wood or a motor but also smaller parts (bolts, wires) and even things you might take for granted (the Feather board).

You can see a [sample BOM here](SampleBOM.md) – don't worry about including the vendor and price, if you don't want to, but for more finished projects this is a really nice thing to add. The goal here is just to think through all the stuff you're going to need to make your project. With that finished, be sure to order anything you know you're going to need so you have it for next week.

Next week we'll do demos as needed but mostly have work time. Bring all your stuff and come ready to work!

### FOR APRIL 12  
For next week, please work on a prototype of your project. This should include all the major elements, including code and the physical elements you plan to use. Your prototype can be rough around the edges (buggy code, things you still need help with, etc) but the major parts should be present: think about "show, not tell"!

Please also start thinking about what you might like to make for your final project. This is totally open-ended, so long as it involves electronics and code in some way.
