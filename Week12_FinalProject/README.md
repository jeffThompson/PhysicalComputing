  * For April 26: WIP, two things you need help with  
  * For May 3: WIP  
  * For May 12: final critique (9.30–11am)  
  * See Canvas for drop-in help hours before the crit!
* Make something amazing using electronics and code

### ASSIGNMENT  
Our last assignment is wide open: make something amazing using electronics and code! The approach, parts you use, physical form, etc is all up to you. The electronics/code can be part of a larger project, but they should be a core component (ie not just a few LEDs stuck on).

Some options include:  
* Artwork (sculpture, installation, etc)  
* Designed/decorative object with electronics embedded in it  
* A tool (keyboard, controller, etc)  
* Wearables  
* CNC-controlled machine  
* Something else entirely!

The two goals for this project should be that you make something polished and ready for your portfolio, and that you make something you're excited to work on. The best projects are the ones you make you procrastinate on all your other work because you're so excited!

### FOR APRIL 19  
For next week, your main assignment is to finish your `Motors` piece, but you should also start thinking about what you'd like to make for your final project. You're welcome to work intuitively and figure out the details as you go, but some planning now will be very helpful.

Please write up a short "pitch" for your final project that includes:  

* **Summary:** 1- or 2-sentence summary of your project (like an abstract or elevator pitch)  
* **Short description:** what do you envision when you think about this piece? What does it look like, what does it do? (2–3 paragraphs)  
* **Things you'll need:** provide a brief list of the parts and supplies you imagine needing (kind of like the BOM we did for the last project, but more speculative)  
* **Things you don't know yet:** at least three things you know you'll need some help with on this project (can be related to code, electronics, materials, tools, etc)  

You're welcome to include additional info, if you want, such as a mood board, projects that inspire you, drawings, etc.

Save your pitch as a `PDF` and upload to Canvas. Be sure to order any parts or supplies that you might need too!

### FOR APRIL 26  
You should start working on your project with the goal of having a rough breadboard demo (or other prototype) finished by next week. Think about the idea an MVP document: what are the big, crucial things that need to get done first and what are the little details that can come later?

Please also write down two (or more) things that you have questions about or need help with next week. These may be leftover from last week's assignment or may be questions that have come up while working on your prototype. They can be about code, electronics, fabrication, or anything else!

No need to submit anything on Canvas, but please be ready to share your questions with the group – we'll chat through some of them as a group.

### FOR MAY 3  
Next week will be a studio day: come ready to work and get help!

***

### FOR MAY 12 (9–11am)  
For the final critique, please finish your project and think about the best way to show it to us. We'll take a look at everything, chat, and record some video documentation together. If you have any late work (including your artist talk responses) please be sure to turn them in before the critique!
