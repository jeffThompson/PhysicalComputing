# BUTTONS AND LEDs

> "Calculation and reasoning, like weaving and ploughing, are work, not for human souls, but for clever combinations of iron and wood" — Mary Everest Boole

For our first project, we'll limit ourselves to just buttons and LEDs. No fancy sensors, motors, or screens. This kind of limitation can drive creativity: the goal is to create something novel, interesting, fun, meaningful, and/or surprising from such simple means.

A few rules (though creative rule-breaking is encouraged):  
* No inputs/outputs other than buttons and LEDs  
* No `println()` commands to the Serial Monitor as part of the finished piece  
* You can use other types of buttons or LEDs if you want  

Over the course of the next few weeks you'll develop a simple breadboard prototype, refine it, and eventually make a polished version that we will document with video.

## DELIVERABLES  
To turn in your project, please upload the following files to Canvas:  
* Photographs or scans of project sketches     
* Photograph of breadboard prototype  

Additionally, we'll shoot a video during class demonstrating your project

## PROJECT TIMELINE  

* **Jan 22:** Project assigned, create ideation drawings, read [*Programming Primer*](https://github.com/jeffThompson/PhysicalComputing/blob/master/Readings/ProgrammingPrimer_ProgrammingInteractivity_JoshuaNoble.pdf), and **order your Arduino board and basic supplies!**    
* **Jan 29:** Feedback session, create refined sketches and breadboard prototype  
* **Feb 5:** Visit Fridman Gallery to see John Driscoll's show *Slight Perturbations*, continue working on project  
* **Feb 12:** Feedback session, finish project, **make sure the rest of your parts are here for next week!**  
* **Feb 19:** Monday schedule, no class!  
* **Feb 26:** Project due, critique  

## FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5/FEBRUARY 12  
**NOTE! We will be going to Fridman Gallery that day!** We will leave from the classroom right at 9am, so please be on time and ready to go. If your Metrocard doesn't have enough money on it, please add some this week too.

Since we won't meet in person on Feb 5, your ongoing assignment is to work on a prototype of your project using your breadboard. This should be a working proof-of-concept that you can demo to the class as well as a way to identify what you need help with and what other materials you'll need. On Feb 12 we'll look at the laser-cutter and have work time.

## FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 22  
**Most important!** Please be sure to order your Arduino board and the basic parts required – do this ASAP so it all arrives before class next week. Not having your parts next week will mean you can't participate in class and will be marked absent. The list of parts is in this repository in the `PartsList.xlsx` file.

Your main assignment this week is to start thinking about what you want to make for this project. Think about how the limitations of the assignment can be generative and try to get past initial ideas and into something unique. Either in your sketchbook (if you're ok tearing pages out) or on separate paper, please make drawings of at least 5 possible ideas for the project. Your drawings don't have to be masterpieces but they should communicate your idea: consider adding labels, detail drawings, notes, etc.

Finally, please also read the *Programming Primer* PDF, found in the `Readings` folder. It's a chapter from [Joshua Noble's excellent book *Programming Interactivity*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021735.do). (You'll notice some of the sections mention Processing and OpenFramework, which we won't be using this semester, but the ideas are the same across almost all programming languages.)

## PROJECTS AND THINGS SHOWN  
* A student project that [displays morse code images in the sky](https://hackaday.com/2012/12/12/observe-a-satellites-morse-code-message-today)... from a satellite!  
* A pretty cool project that pushes the idea of simple interface: [a full operating system with only one button](https://hackaday.com/2016/10/08/minimal-operating-system-one-button-one-led)  
* Artist Tatsuo Miyajima's piece [*C.T.C.S. Flower Dance*](https://tatsuomiyajima.com/work-projects/c-t-c-s-flower-dance), which embeds LEDs in the surface of six mirrors (see also Miyajima's [show at Lisson Gallery](https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/tatsuo-miyajima-innumerable-life-buddha) in Chelsea, open until Feb 16)  

*Historical comupter interface devices, and other means of encoding information:*  
* Douglass Engelbart's [*Mother of All Demos*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5PgQS3ZBWA), a public demonstration in 1968 of many firsts: the first computer mouse, interactive computing, and video teleconferencing  
* Mattel's 1977 handheld game [*Football*](http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/FB.htm), notable for having just size buttons and some LEDs ([see it in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuEbVy6iTJ0))  
* [A cool site from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection/browse.aspx?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fbibuxton%2Fbuxtoncollection%2Fbrowse.aspx) showing historical computer input devices

* [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), remarkable for using just two values (a short and long pulse) to encode letters to be sent via [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy) (which in itself has an intersting history: smoke, fires, and reflected light have all been used to send messages over great distances)  
* [Binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) also uses just two values (0 and 1) to encode everything from numbers to videos and books and websites  
* [Flag semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore) is another encoding system, used to send visual signals over long distances
