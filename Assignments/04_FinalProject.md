# FINAL PROJECT  
### CRIT MAY 7, DOCUMENTATION MAY 10  

Our final project together this semester is open-ended: make something that you're excited about using electronics! The format, content, and tools used are completely up to you but should be something you'll be excited to work on for the next four weeks. Think about what you found interesting this semester, didn't have time to work on, and/or connects to other classes or interests.

As a major part of your final grade, this project should also show off what you've learned and how your work has improved this semester. Your piece should be considered in terms of materials, craft, idea, and iteration from idea to prototype to finished piece.

**Please note!** The project is due the last regular day of class but you'll turn it in a few days later during the exam time. This is meant to give you some time to make changes and to document your piece. We will not meet in person during the exam period!

## DELIVERABLES  
For the critique, please:  
* Have your project finished and ready to show to the class

To turn in your project on the exam date, please upload the following files to Canvas:  
* 2-3 photographs of your project  
* A comment with a short description of your project: what it does, a little bit about how it works  
* A comment with a bill-of-materials (BOM) listing the parts and materials used in your project  

## PROJECT TIMELINE  
* **April 9:** Project assigned, create project proposal and drawings, finish 3D model of bracket  
* **April 16:** Feedback on final project ideas, breadboard prototype and refined proposal, print bracket in Fab Lab, install EagleCAD  
* **April 23:** Small-group feedback on prototypes, EagleCAD demos, work day  
* **April 30:** Work day, demos as needed, finish project  
* **May 7:** Project due! Critique of projects  
* **Exam period (May 10):** turn in online documentation of project by 5pm (we won't meet in person)  

## FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 16  
For next week, please think about what you'd like to make for your final project and write up a short proposal that includes the following (about 1 paragraph for each section below):

* What: Describe the project overall – what will you be making, how will we experience it, materials, etc – the "elevator pitch."  
* Why: Tell us why you're excited to make this project.  
* Who: List at least 3 artists, designers, musicians, or artworks that are inspiration for this project and how they connect to your idea.  
* Timeline: For each week until the project is due, briefly describe what you plan to get done. It may be helpful to work in reverse from the crit back to this week.  
* Materials/supplies: List the materials you think you'll need for the project, including where you'll get them from. This will eventually turn into a more formal bill-of-materials later.  

Along with your proposal, please also create at least one refined drawing of what you envision your piece will look like. This can be done digitally or by hand and should clearly show how the piece will look, what it does, etc. Feel free to add notes, arrows, labels, etc. **Be sure to print both your drawing and proposal and bring them to class!**
