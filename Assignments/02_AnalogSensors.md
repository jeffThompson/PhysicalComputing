# ANALOG SENSORS  
### DUE TUESDAY, MARCH 26

For our next project, we'll move from digital inputs and outputs, which only have on or off values, to analog sensors. This will let us capture a huge range of real-world inputs, from temperature to distance to acceleration to soil moisture. Your assignment is to build something that uses at least one analog sensor as it's input. The piece might use the sensor's input in realtime (ex: to visualize or sonify the data in some way or use it to control an output) or it can be used to generate something (ex: to record sensor data and use it as a design tool). You're encouraged to think outside the traditional materials as well! What happens if you mix objects from the natural world with electronics, or embed small sensors in a much larger installation?

Your project might be sculptural, interactive, visual, sonic, playful, immersive, designed, messy, etc etc etc – but the finished piece should be thoughtfully considered in terms of the idea, materials, and craft.

## DELIVERABLES  
To turn in your project, please upload the following files to Canvas:  
* 2-3 photographs of your project  
* A short description of your project: what it does, a little bit about how it works, materials used  

## PROJECT TIMELINE  
* **March 5:** Project assigned, analog sensor demos and intro to electricity  
* **March 12:** Project prototypes due, voltage dividers and Ohm's law, generating sound and video, intro to woodworking tools  
* **March 19:** Spring break, no class! Continue working on your project over break  
* **March 26:** Projects due, critique

## FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 12  
For next week, start by sketching ideas for your project. These should be quick, with the goal of getting lots of ideas out on the page. Once you've come to a better idea of what you'd like to do, please make a more refined drawing of your project. This should be larger (approx 8.5x11") and much more detailed – think of it as a first-round prototype that can communicate your idea to others. Try to use drawing as a tool for working through your ideas, refining as you go. You're welcome to do this drawing by hand or digitally, whichever is more comfortable for you.

Once you've refined your idea, please create a working prototype of your sensor's input on a breadboard. Keep a list of things you don't know how to do or are stuck on so we can address them in class.

## FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 26  
For next class (in two weeks), please continue to refine and finish your project. Like with the `Buttons and LEDs` project, think about the final presentation: materials, scale, touch, interaction, etc. When it's done, take 2-3 photographs of your project that show what it does, how it's used, etc. These can be with your phone, but consider the location you shoot: documentation is part of the work! Upload your photos to Canvas along with a short description.
