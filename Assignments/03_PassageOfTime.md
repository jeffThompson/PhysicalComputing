# PASSAGE OF TIME  
### DUE TUESDAY, APRIL 9

For our last project before the final, we'll explore the idea of the passage of time. Your project should in some way show, record, or make time physical. The most obvious device for this is a [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), but even that is deceptively simple: at what rate should the hands rotate? Most clocks show hours and minutes, some record the day or even year, others show milliseconds. Some show time using the traditional rotating hands, but [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock), [sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass), and even the [burning of incense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense_clock) have been used to mark time. Other devices, like a metronome, don't count up time but simply divide it. Time is experienced differently by different cultures, feels longer or shorter depending on what we're doing, it's direction is even [defined by a fundamental idea in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time).

Feel free to explore non-standard or extreme ptimescales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time), find interesting ways to show or record time, and to experiment with scale and materials.

## DELIVERABLES  
To turn in your project, please upload the following files to Canvas:  
* 2-3 photographs of your project  
* A short description of your project: what it does, a little bit about how it works, materials used  

## PROJECT TIMELINE  
* **March 26:** Project assigned, motor demos, CAD basics and 3D-printing  
* **April 2:** Prototypes due, stepper motors and end-stops  
* **April 9:** Project due, critique, ideation for final project  

## FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 2  
This week, start ideating and prototyping your project, with the goal of a work-in-progress prototype for next class. Try to identify things you'll need help with, materials needed, and think about how your piece will be installed and experienced.

Please also print the motor bracket we designed in class in the Fab Lab. You can print the first one for free (be sure to mention you're in this class) but any other printing you'll want to do will be $0.10 per gram.

## FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 9  
For next week, please finish your project. This is the time to get really picky about materials, scale, and interaction. How do you want us to experience and engage your project? How big should it be? How can your materials choice best communicate your idea? Your piece should be ready to set up in class for critique. We'll have an ideation session for your final project, so you can start thinking about what you might want to make for that as well.
