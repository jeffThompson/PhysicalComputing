### ASSIGNMENT
This week, your only task is to get the supplies you'll need for our next class. I'm suggesting you get your parts directly from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com), a wonderful company based in NYC and started by [Limor Fried](https://github.com/readme/podcast/limor-fried-adafruit). Adafruit has been an amazing, long-time supporter of the open source hardware community, releasing their own tools and products, and publishing tons of tutorials... plus they're a woman-owned tech company!

> ⚠️ **Order your parts today, like now!** Adafruit ships quickly and they are close by, but this will ensure you have everything you need for class next week. You can probably find most of these things on Amazon too, but the quality is harder to gauge and supporting a local business is always a great move.

You're welcome to order the other supplies listed now if you want, but you won't need all that stuff until later in the semester.

In addition, but completely optional, you may want to purchase some tools for this class. We'll provide them in the Studio and Fab Lab, but it's always nice to have your own:

* Wire strippers ([ok](https://www.adafruit.com/product/147), [nice](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14872), [fave](https://www.amazon.com/Greenlee-1113-Stripax-Stripper-Cutter/dp/B0006BHCFO))  
* Flush (aka diagonal) cutters ([fave](https://www.adafruit.com/product/152))  
* Soldering iron and lead-free solder ([ok](https://www.adafruit.com/product/180), [nice](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3565), [fave](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M/ref=sr_1_1))  
* Pack of heat-shrink tubing ([assortment](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4559)) and a lighter or small blowtorch ([fave](https://www.amazon.com/3-1-Butane-Micro-Torch/dp/B00OQS6IRG/ref=sr_1_2))  
* De-soldering pump ([ok](https://www.adafruit.com/product/148), [fave](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1597))  
* Very optional: auto-ranging multimeter ([totally fine](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12966), [fave](https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-115-Compact-True-RMS-Multimeter/dp/B000OCFFMW/ref=sr_1_2?crid=32CT4SBMANDU7&keywords=fluke+115&qid=1642519051&sprefix=fluke+115%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-2))  
* Also very optional: helping-hands tool ([decent but not great](https://www.adafruit.com/product/291), [fave](https://www.ottofrei.com/GRS-Third-Hands-On-Weighted-Base))

You can get almost all of these at Home Depot or online. There are lots of options/price ranges for all of these items, so we'll go over them in class.

If you have any questions about what to order, email me!
