### ASSIGNMENT
This week, your only task is to get the supplies you'll need for our next class. I'm suggesting you get your parts directly from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com), a wonderful company based in NYC and started by [Limor Fried](https://github.com/readme/podcast/limor-fried-adafruit). Adafruit has been an amazing, long-time supporter of the open source hardware community, releasing their own tools and products, and publishing tons of tutorials... plus they're a woman-owned tech company!

\[ [Link to a list of required supplies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eFKwcQB5PgZMCaIBkQ6jCpR6jHgA8spqsIOZDBLMFAg/edit?usp=sharing) \]

**Order your parts today, like now!** Adafruit ships quickly and they are close by, but this will ensure you have everything you need for class next week. You can probably find most of these things on Amazon too, but the quality is harder to gauge and supporting a local business is always a great move.

You're welcome to order the other supplies listed now if you want, but you won't need all that stuff until later in the semester.

If you have any questions about what to order, email me!
