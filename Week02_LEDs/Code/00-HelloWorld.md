# HELLO, WORLD!

Before we start turning on/off LEDs and wiring up circuits, let's look at how we can upload code to our boards and cover some Python basics.

If you haven't already, be sure to [follow the steps for connecting and updating your board](https://github.com/jeffThompson/PhysicalComputing/blob/master/Week02_LEDs/SettingUpYourBoard.md) first.

***

### CONNECT THE BOARD
First, we need to get the board and Mu Editor talking to each other:

1. Connect your board to your computer via USB, like before. It should show up as `CIRCUITPY`  
2. Open Mu Editor and click the `Load` button. Select the `code.py` file. You should now see a blank file where we can write some code  
3. Click the `Serial` button at the top of the editor. This lets us see messages from the board, like the console in a web browser. We'll use this a lot for debugging  

We'll use these steps every time you go to work on a project.

***

### OUR FIRST PROGRAM  
Let's verify everything is working and write our first Circuit Python program!

In the editor, copy/paste or type this line (you can delete anything else that's already there):

    print('Hello, world!')

Click the `Save` button to save your code to the board. You should immediately see some output in the Serial Console:

    Auto-reload is on. Simply save files over USB to run them or enter REPL to disable.
    code.py output:
    Hello, world!

    Code done running.

    Press any key to enter the REPL. Use CTRL-D to reload.

There's a bunch of stuff we don't have to worry about yet, but the important thing is that it displays the text we wrote using the `print()` command. Nice!

Try changing the text inside the `print()` command. Save it and watch the console again. 

**CHALLENGES**  
1. Can you add additional `print()` commands to display extra text?

***

### PYTHON BASICS  
This week you'll learn to turn on/off LEDs. But first, let's go over some basics of Python, the langauge we'll be using to program our board. Python is a fantastic, flexible, and friendly language and is one of my faves.

This guide (and subsequent demos) assumes you've done at least some basic programming before. You should know a bit about variables, conditionals, and loops but it's ok if you've never used Python!

***

### PRINT  
We've already covered this command! `print()` is super helpful for debugging, especially when working with a board like the Feather that has no display of its own.

Any values inside `print()` will show up in the console. This includes text, variables, lists, etc.

***

### COMMENTS  
Comments are code that isn't run, but instead is there to offer info to people reading it. Adding comments is a great habit to get into. Not only is it the professional thing to do, it also leaves notes for yourself when you come back later and try to remember what the heck you were doing! In Python, we can create two kinds of comments.

**SINGLE LINE**  
Any text after a `#` symbol is a comment. These can be on a line of their own...

    # turn the LED on

...or after a line of code:

    a = 2 * 3   # multiply two numbers together

**MULTIPLE LINE**  
For larger blocks of text, you can create multi-line comments. These start and end with three quote-marks, either single- or double-quotes:

    '''
    This comment is on multiple lines.
    It starts and ends with three quote-marks.
    '''

    """
    This works too!
    """

### VARIABLES  
In Python, variables are ["un-typed,"](https://fosterv222.medium.com/coding-languages-typed-vs-untyped-d29c7e0b3713) meaning we don't have to tell Python if a value is a number or text or something else. To create a variable, all we need to do is give it a name and an initial value!

    a = -5          # an integer (whole number)
    b = 3.14        # a floating-point number (decimal)
    c = 'Python'    # a string (text)

Typically in Python, variables are written in all lowercase with underscores in between words. Other languages, like Javascript, usually write variables in `camelCase` instead. Both will work, but all the examples here will use the usual Python convention:


    a_longer_variable_name = 9.875

There are a few specific variable types that are a bit different than other languages...

**BOOLEAN**  
A variable can be boolean (true/false) too but are always written with the first letter capitalized!

    i_like_donuts =    True
    i_like_mushrooms = False

**NONE**  
You may see a variable with a value of `None` from time to time. This is similar to `null` in Java and `undefined` in Javascript, meaning a variable with no value.

    friends = None   # :(

**LISTS**  
List handling is one of the best parts of Python. Lists are noted with square brackets:

    pets = [ 'June', 'Kahn' ]

We can get the length of a list using `len()`:

    print( len(pets) )

Adding an item is easy:

    pets.append('Manchego')

There's a ton more we can do with lists in Python, but for now we'll leave it there! There are lots of great resources online if you want more.

***

### MATH  
Python uses the same mathematical symbols as other programming languages.

    +   add
    -   subtract
    *   multiply
    /   divide
    ()  parentheses help set the order of operations

Some more specialized operations (like square root) may require importing the math library, which we do at the top of our code.

    import math
    root = math.sqrt(9)

You can find a [full list of math operations in the Circuit Python documentation](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/math/index.html).

***

### CONDITIONALS  
Aka `if/else` statements. This is where Python can get a little tricky because we don't use curly brackets like most langauges. Instead, Python requires you to indent code to tell it what's part of your if-statement. You'll also notice we don't use parentheses either!

    number_of_donuts = 2
    number_of_people = 3
    if number_of_donuts < number_of_people:
      print('There are not enough donuts!')
    else:
      print('Whew, there are enough donuts')

We can combine multiple conditionals using `and`...

    like_dogs = True
    dog_nearby = True
    if like_dogs and dog_nearby:
      print('Go say hi to the dog!')

...and `or` too:

    am_hungry = True
    cost_of_slice = 2 
    my_money = 4.50
    if am_hungry:
      if my_money > cost_of_slice:
        print('Pizza!')
      else:
        print('Not enough money for pizza...')

If we need to check more than two combinations, we can add `else-if` to our conditionals too. Note that this is shortened in Python to `elif`:

    current_time = 3
    if current_time < 9:
      print('Not time for work yet')
    elif current_time >= 9 and current_time < 5:
      print('Work time!')
    else:
      print('Go home already')

***

### ITERATION  
Like conditionals, iteration is indented and doesn't use curly brackets. First, let's count from 0â€“9...

    for i in range(0, 10):
      print(i)

Do the same thing, but count by twos...

    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
      print(i)

We can go backwards too...

    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
      print(i)

Python makes going through lists easy...

    vehicles = [ 'car', 'bus', 'truck', 'scooter', 'bike' ]
    for vehicle in vehicles:
      print(vehicle)

***

### FUNCTIONS  
Lastly, like in other languages, Python lets us create our own functions. These are indented just like conditionals and loops, and can include arguments, both required and optional.

We have to create our function above the code where we use it. Let's make a simple function that adds two numbers:

    def add(a, b):
      result = a + b 
      return result
    
Then we can use it!

    c = add(10, 50)
    print(c)

This function has an optional argument with a preset value. If we don't include anything for that argument, Python will use the default listed.

    def punctuate(s1, s2, punct='.'):
      return s1 + ' ' + s2 + punct

    print( punctuate('Lovely', 'day') )
    print( punctuate('Wonderful', 'donuts', '!') )

***

Of course, there's lots more Python can do and lots we haven't covered! But with these basics you should be able to do almost everything you need for this class, with a little Google/Stack Overflow searching from time to time.

If you find something we haven't covered that would be helpful, please let me know!
