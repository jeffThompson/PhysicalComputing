# LEDs

### TLDR  
* Due Feb 1  
* Meet IRL next week!  
* Create a project using at least two LEDs  
* No additional components yet, see what you can do with just LEDs!  
* Bring next week:  
  * All the supplies you ordered  
  * A USB cable that fits your board/computer  
  * Your laptop/charger  
  * Sketchbook or notebook

### ASSIGNMENT
This week, we'll limit oursleves to just your microcontrollers and a handful of LEDs. No fancy sensors, motors, etc yet; instead, the goal is to get comfortable with programming, uploading code to your board, and thinking creatively!

A few rules for this project\*:  
* Use at least two LEDs  
* Either on/off or pulse-width modulation (PWM)  
* No other inputs/outputs other than LEDs!  
* But any other materials you want to incorporate are great (found objects, sculptural, drawing/painting, etc)  

\*Creative rule-breaking is encouraged in this class! Embrace the limitations and think about what novel, interesting, fun, meaningful, and/or surprising things you can make with such simple means.
