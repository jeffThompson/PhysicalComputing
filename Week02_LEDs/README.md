# LEDs

### TLDR  
* Due Feb 1 at the start of class  
* Meet IRL next week!  
* Create a project using at least two LEDs  
* No additional components yet, see what you can do with just LEDs!
* Turn in a photo of your project and a short description of what it does on Canvas  
* Bring next week:  
  * All the supplies you ordered  
  * A USB cable that fits your board/computer  
  * Your laptop/charger  
  * Sketchbook or notebook

### ASSIGNMENT
This week, we'll limit oursleves to just your microcontrollers and a handful of LEDs. No fancy sensors, motors, etc yet; instead, the goal is to get comfortable with programming, uploading code to your board, and thinking creatively!

A few rules for this project:  
* Use at least two LEDs  
* Either on/off or pulse-width modulation (PWM)  
* No other inputs/outputs other than LEDs!  
* But any other materials you want to incorporate are great (found objects, sculptural, drawing/painting, etc)  

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Creative rule-breaking is encouraged in this class! Embrace the limitations and think about what novel, interesting, fun, meaningful, and/or surprising things you can make with such simple means.

### WHERE TO GET HELP  
Getting stuck is a normal part of these kinds of projects. We're covering a ton of new material across a range of fields. Learning where and how to get help when you're stuck is an important skill.

If you find yourself stuck, I would suggest:  
* Take a break! Go get lunch or take a walk ‚Äì you'd be amazed how helpful giving your brain a break can be  
* Explain the problem to a friend, either IRL or in an email (you don't even have to send it!)  

If that doesn't work, you can try:  
* Email me!  
* [Circuit Python overview](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview)  
* [Post to the Adafruit forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=60)  
* [Way more detail on Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/index.html) (probably most helpful if you've done some Python before)
