# SPRITES  

We've seen how to create shapes, load images, and even access individual pixels. For our last example, let's take a look at how we can load and display animations!

When we're done, you should end up with an animation that looks like this:

![](Images/Sprite.png)

[*Sprites*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) are a simple but very effective way of creating animations. A sprite is a single frame of an animation ‚Äì for example: a person walking ‚Äì which are shown one after another to create the illusion of movement. Sprites can be stored as separate images, but often all the frames are combined into a single image, called a *sprite sheet.* When loaded, the software slices up the sprite sheet into individual sprites.

### PREPARE YOUR SPRITE SHEET  

For this example, we'll use a modified version of [this walk cycle animation](https://stock.adobe.com/hk/images/business-man-walk-cycle-sprite-sheet-animation-frames-silhouette-loop-animation/183196051). I downloaded it, moved everything around so the frames are centered, and exported it as a single BMP file. (If you need a reminder how to do that, see the [Load Images](04-LoadImages.md) example.) I've also included the tile size (the dimensions of each frame) in the filename, so I don't have to open the file and figure it out.

The final sprite sheet looks like this:

![](Images/WalkCycle-42x64px.bmp)

But we can think of it as being made of 17 separate images, each 42x64 pixels.

### BASIC SETUP  

Before we load the sprite sheet, let's load the libraries and set up the display:

```python
import board
import displayio
import time

import adafruit_displayio_sh1107
import adafruit_imageload

width =  128
height = 64

displayio.release_displays()
i2c = board.I2C()
display_bus = displayio.I2CDisplay(i2c, device_address=0x3C)
display = adafruit_displayio_sh1107.SH1107(
    display_bus, 
    width =    width, 
    height =   height, 
    rotation = 0
)
frame = displayio.Group()
display.show(frame)
```

Let's also change the background color:

```python
def background(color):
  bitmap =  displayio.Bitmap(width, height, 1)
  palette = displayio.Palette(1)
  palette[0] = color
  bg = displayio.TileGrid(
    bitmap,
    pixel_shader = palette,
    x = 0,
    y = 0
  )
  frame.append(bg)

background(0xFFFFFF)
```

***

### LOAD THE SPRITE SHEET  

Now we can load the sprites! Let's first define some parameters. We'll need these to properly load and animate the sprite later:

```python
sprite_filename = 'Images/WalkCycle-42x64px.bmp'
sprite_width =    42
sprite_height =   64
num_frames =      17
```

Then let's load it! Adafruit's library does a great job of simplifying this process. First we load the file:

```python
sprite_file, palette = adafruit_imageload.load(
  sprite_filename,
  bitmap = displayio.Bitmap,
  palette = displayio.Palette
)
```

Then create a variable (I'm calling this `walker` since it's someone walking) and split the main image into frames:

```python
walker = displayio.TileGrid(
  sprite_file,
  pixel_shader = palette,
  width =  1,
  height = 1,
  tile_width =  sprite_width,
  tile_height = sprite_height
)
frame.append(walker)
```

Finally, let's give our person an x/y position and a direction of movement:

```python
walker.x =  0
walker.y =  0
direction = 1
```

***

### MAKE IT MOVE!  

A static sprite is no fun, so let's animate it! Our `walker` variable contains all the frames in our sprite sheet. To make it animate, we need to update which frame is being shown every time the while-loop comes around. We can do that by creating a variable `index` and using that to determine which frame is displayed:

```python
index = 0
while True:
  # determine which frame should be displayed
  walker[0] = index
  
  # update the index for the next frame
  # if we've exceeded the number of frames,
  # loop back around
  index += 1
  if index == num_frames:
    index = 0

  time.sleep(0.05)
```

Save this to your board. You should see the character walking in place! 

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why `walker[0]`? This is part of the weird way graphics are handled on these boards. In this case, the first element in `walker` is the sprite that's being displayed, with all the other ones hidden away. We tell the display which frame to show by setting `walker[0]`. Confusing for sure...

Ok! Next, let's make them walk forward. To do this, all we need to do is update the `x` position each frame, right after we update which frame is displayed:

```python
walker.x += direction
```

Nice... but the figure walks offscreen. Let's fix that:

```python
if walker.x < 0:
  walker.flip_x = False
  direction *= -1
elif walker.x > width-sprite_width:
  walker.flip_x = True
  direction *= -1
```

Two things are happening here:

1. `walker.flip_x`: this is a fantastic function built into the Adafruit library! It flips an image in the horizontal direction, changing which way the person is facing  
2. `direction *= -1`: by multiplying the direction by `‚Äì1`, it reverses the way the figure will walk

import adafruit_displayio_sh1107
import adafruit_imageload

# variables for the sprite
sprite_filename = 'WalkCycle-42x64px.bmp'

sprite_height =   64
num_frames =      17

width =           128
height =          64

# setup the display
displayio.release_displays()
i2c = board.I2C()

    display_bus, 
    width =    width, 
    height =   height, 
    rotation = 0
)
frame = displayio.Group()
display.show(frame)

def background(color):
  bitmap =  displayio.Bitmap(width, height, 1)
  palette = displayio.Palette(1)
  palette[0] = color
  bg = displayio.TileGrid(
    bitmap,
    pixel_shader = palette,
    x = 0,
    y = 0
  )
  frame.append(bg)

background(0xFFFFFF)

# load the sprite
sprite_file, palette = adafruit_imageload.load(
  sprite_filename,
  bitmap = displayio.Bitmap,
  palette = displayio.Palette
)
walker = displayio.TileGrid(
  sprite_file,
  pixel_shader = palette,
  width =  1,
  height = 1,
  tile_width =  sprite_width,
  tile_height = sprite_height
)
frame.append(walker)

walker.x = 0
walker.y = 0
direction = 1

# make them walk!
index = 0
while True:
  # set which frame of the animation to draw
  walker[0] = index
  
  # update which frame will be onscreen
  # next and loop if we've reached the end
  index += 1
  if index == num_frames:
    index = 0

  # move the person forward
  walker.x += direction

  # have them reverse when they hit the edges
  if walker.x < 0:
    walker.flip_x = False
    direction *= -1
    index = 10
  elif walker.x > width-sprite_width:
    walker.flip_x = True
    direction *= -1
    index = 10

  time.sleep(0.05)
```

### CHALLENGES  

1. Can you make the figure walk the other direction when a button is pressed?
