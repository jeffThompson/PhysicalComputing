### ASSIGNMENT  

So far, we've looked at tons of different inputs to the Feather but our only output device has been LEDs. We're going to dive into motors next, but for this project you'll explore sound and/or video using the Feather. You are welcome to incorporate sensors, sculptural elements, communication with your computer, and/or other audio or video devices.

### FOR MARCH 29  

For next week, please create a breadboard prototype of your project. This should inclue all the basic funcationality of your piece, though it can be buggy! The goal here is not to focus on perfecting one small part of the project, but getting all the pieces together quickly so you can really see what's going on.

Some things to think about:  
* How is the piece activated? Do you push a button, is it triggered by you walking by, does it just go on its own?  
* What form factor makes the most sense for your idea?  
* What other materials do you want to incorporate? Fabric, jello, smoke, confetti, a tree stump... what creates the sense experience you want?  
* What should the overall vibe of the project be? Heavy metal or ultra-minimal? Organic or geometric? Huge or tiny?  

**NOTE!** Next week, we'll meet in class for a quick feedback and troubleshooting session, then we'll head into NYC to see [Daniel Rozen's show at Bitforms gallery](https://bitforms.art/exhibition/daniel-rozin-shades/). **PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR METROCARD HAS MONEY ON IT BEFORE CLASS!** We'll take the PATH to the subway, then do some walking – please let me know if that will be an issue for you. Depending on time, we may be able to swing by Canal Plastics too.

### FOR APRIL 5  

This week, please finish your project. That's it: come ready to show what you have!

Please also bring your servo motor – we'll start talking about kinetic art and how to make things move!
