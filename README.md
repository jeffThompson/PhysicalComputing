This semester, we will explore electronics, code, sculpture and fabrication to build interactive projects. You’ll learn to use the popular, open-source Arduino platform, allowing you to get input from the world into your computer (buttons, knobs, sensors) and let your computer interact with the world (LEDs, motors, speakers). You’ll also learn basic CAD for laser-cutting and 3D printing, how to use woodshop tools, and to design and solder electronic circuits. Along the way, we’ll consider the interfaces and objects used historically to connect people with computers, we’ll build speculative and exploratory projects, and work to refine those projects from rough prototype to finished work.
