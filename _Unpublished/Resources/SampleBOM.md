# SAMPLE BOM

A bill-of-materials (or BOM) is a list of all the parts used to create a project. This is a useful way for you to keep track of what you used in case you need replacement parts or want to use something in another project, but also as a way to share the "source" for physical projects! (Interested in learning more about open source hardware? Check out the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/).)

## What to include?  
A basic BOM should include:

* Part description (including size info for things like bolts)  
* Price per part  
* Quantity needed  
* Vendor (where did you buy it from?)  
* URL

You might also consider including:  

* Price total (price each x quantity needed)  
* Notes on anything important, like why the part is needed or modifications that will have to be made  
* Alternative vendor and URL
