  BASIC SKETCH
  Jeff Thompson | 2018 | jeffreythompson.org

  An Arduino "sketch" (our code) requires a basic
  structure: a setup and loop function.

  To use the code you've written, there are four
  steps:

  1. In Tools, set up the correct board (probably 
     "Arduino/Genuino Uno") and serial port
  2. Verify your code by clicking the checkmark button
     or Sketch > Verify/Compile (or command/control+R)
  3. If there are no errors, upload to the board by
     clicking the arrow button or Sketch > Upload (or
     command/control+U)
  4. Verify that your Arduino does what you thought it
     would; refine and iterate on your code

  Try verifying and uploading this blank sketch!

void setup() {

  /*
    Setup happens once when the program starts or the
    Arduino reboots

    Here you'll put options for input/output pins, the
    serial connection for sending messages, and anything
    that only needs to happen once
  */

}


void loop() {

  /*
    The loop runs repeatedly, as fast as possible, after
    the setup function is done

    This is where you would check buttons and sensors,
    trigger events, etc
  */

}
